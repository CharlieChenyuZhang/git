# git: what it does:
> A C program that computes a simple hash function for input data read from the command line. The hash function we will use is based on the boolean exclusive or (xor) operation.




# how to run it:
> step one: download the repo

> step two: go to the terminal and use cd to the directory where you can find two files called compute_hash.c and hash_functions.c

> step three: copy the following line into your command line to compile the files: gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o compute_hash compute_hash.c hash_functions.c

> step four: you can play around with the file
